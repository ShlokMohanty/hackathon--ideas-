Hi Guys,
Social Distancing is the most important thing which we have to keep in mind in this period of corona virus.
The idea is to create a social distancing band(which i call "the band gap").
This band will help people to follow the social distancing principle in places like roads , malls, parks and other public areas.
The working principle of these bands will be that they will be connected to each other via bluetooth so when two people will come 
closer to each other, a buzzer will sound saying that "maintain social distancing". Moreover, it will have an application for your phones
that before going out it will remind you about wearing a mask once you feed your office timings or u can say, whenever you will go out.
Moreover it will be helpful to the police as it will report a message to them if a group of people are not maintaining social distancing
as the band will detect the no. of similar bluetooth frequencies like itself in an area less than 1 square meter. It will also remind people to \
to wear it as it will be connected to their phones so if a person will go out of the house with their phones, it will automaically send a 
notification to wear the band .
