In today's world during lockdown people are managing thier studies and work from home in order to maintain social distancing. Where students are managing to keep with their studies through E-learning or virtual meetings. There are some students on the other hand who don't have access to such kind of privilige. let's take for an example a blind student. So my idea is to try and figure out to build something for the betterment of blind people so that even they can have access to privileges like E-learning and can catch with their day-to-day studies and work like a normal human -being.
